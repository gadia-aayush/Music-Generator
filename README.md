### Readme- Music Generator

#### Brief Description-
- Here a model is built that uses LSTM to generate music. We have trained our model on corpus of Jazz music.

#### Methods Used-
- LSTM

#### Technologies Used-
- Python
- Keras
- Numpy
- Matplotlib

#### Getting Started-
- Just clone the entire repo and run the Jupyter Notebook.

#### Output-
- [actual output](https://github.com/gadia-aayush/Music-Generator/blob/master/output/my_music.midi)
- [converted to mp3 output](https://github.com/gadia-aayush/Music-Generator/blob/master/output/my_music.mp3)
- [Rest the output can be seen in Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/gadia-aayush/Music-Generator/blob/master/jazz-improvisation-with-lstm.ipynb).
